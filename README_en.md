The CN **WorkBuddy** and the international **WorkBuddy AI** coexist: install one app and its model group
appears; install both and the two groups sit side by side, each with its own account and credit. The
models appear directly in the DSH model picker — no separate provider to configure.

  <em>The CN version forms its own group in the model picker, each model carrying its credit rate and promo
  badge; installing the international version adds a "WorkBuddy AI" group the same way.</em>
</p>

## Capabilities

- **Zero configuration** — install, enable, and the model group appears by itself.
- **Two isolated versions** — "WorkBuddy" (CN) and "WorkBuddy AI" (international) each form their own group;
  models, accounts and credit never mix, and each follows only its own app's sign-in.
- **Reasoning levels** — models that declare levels expose them directly; the rest can be **checked manually**
  on the plugin page. The bulb means "this model can switch levels", not "it has been detected" — a declared
  model shows the bulb too, it just has nothing to detect.
- **Credit in view** — each reply shows what it consumed, and remaining credit sits beside the model picker.
  Nothing renders when a figure cannot be observed.
- **Model visibility** — tick which models appear in the picker on the card's "Models" tab, saved per
  signed-in account.
- **Image input** — most models accept pasted or dropped images; text-only models say so explicitly.
- **Three surfaces** — Web, Desktop and TUI; only the TUI lacks manual detection.

## Install

One prerequisite: the **WorkBuddy desktop app** is installed and signed in (WorkBuddy AI for the
international version) — the plugin reuses the app's sign-in state.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-bridge
dsh web
```

For Desktop and TUI swap `--profile web` for `desktop` / `dsh-tui` (the TUI needs the terminal plugin
`@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` ≥ `0.10.0-beta.5` — see its docs).

Or from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zlZayn/dsh-workbuddy-bridge.git
cd dsh-workbuddy-bridge
pnpm install && pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"
```

## The plugin page

Sidebar **Plugins** → installed → click **DSH WorkBuddy Bridge**. The configuration area sits right under
the description and takes effect on save:

- **Sign-in file paths** (CN / international) — leave blank to use the app's own location.
- **Allow reasoning-level detection** and **use the largest declared context window** — two switches.

  <img src="assets/models-tab.png" alt="Models tab: visibility, windows, rates" width="480">
  <br>
  <em>The Models tab: tick which models appear in the picker, and read each one's window and rate.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/detection-tab.png" alt="Detection tab: one row per reasoning model" width="300">
  <img src="assets/credits-tab.png" alt="Credits tab: the total balance and per-package allowances" width="300">
  <br>
  <em>Left, "Detection": one row per reasoning model — press the button to confirm which reasoning levels it
  accepts. Right, "Credits": the total balance, each package's allowance as a row below.</em>
</p>

## Why detection is manual

The upstream does not guarantee that level information is reliable — some models were observed to
**accept** `reasoning_effort` while silently ignoring unknown values. So the plugin does not guess: it
confirms one model at a time with a few real requests on demand, and a result only means **the upstream
currently accepts that level** — it does not promise any change in behaviour. Models that declare their
levels skip this step and use the declared set directly.
Mechanism and trade-offs in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
