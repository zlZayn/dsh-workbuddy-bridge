/**
 * The two WorkBuddy desktop apps this one plugin serves.
 *
 * Both products are the same client framework in different regions, and both
 * write their sign-in into the *same* shared `CodeBuddyExtension` auth
 * directory — they differ by file basename, base URL, catalog endpoint, and
 * display identity. Everything that varies between them is collected here as
 * one descriptor, so no module has to carry its own `if (international)`
 * branch and a third variant would be a data change rather than a refactor.
 *
 * This module is host-side (it names files and env vars). The browser half
 * takes the same ids and routes from the Node-free `status-paths.ts`, which
 * stays the single source shared by both halves.
 *
 * @module dsh-workbuddy-bridge/variants
