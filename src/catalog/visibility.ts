/**
 * Per-account model-visibility preferences: which models the signed-in account
 * has hidden from the DSH model picker (issue #36).
 *
 * A hidden-*id* list, deliberately not an enabled whitelist: a new account and a
 * model the upstream adds both start visible, and an id that temporarily
 * disappears from the catalog is kept — when the model returns it stays hidden
 * until this account says otherwise. Entries are also kept across sign-outs, so
 * returning to an account restores exactly what it left.
 *
 * One file per variant (the two endpoints share model ids but never
 * preferences), keyed by the same `uid:enterpriseId` identity the saved
 * catalogs and probe records use. Not a place for secrets: model-id strings
 * only, never a token, and never written into the desktop auth file or the
 * plugin-owned credential copy — hiding a model is a picker preference, not
 * credential state.
 *
 * Why a plugin-owned file rather than a settings section: the settings sections
 * are statically-typed schemastery objects, and `settings.yaml` is account-global
 * — a per-uid dynamic map fits neither without weakening the schema or mixing
 * one account's preferences into another's config. The saved-catalog and probe
 * stores already persist per-account data this way, so this store follows them:
 * version-tagged document, atomic write with `0o600`, and a malformed file that
 * reads as "nothing saved" rather than throwing.
 *
