/**
 * WorkBuddy 5.6.x at-rest credential protection: classification, key
 * resolution, and field decryption for the desktop app's encrypted auth file.
 *
 * Since WorkBuddy 5.6 the desktop app encrypts `auth.accessToken` and
 * `auth.refreshToken` at rest (`buildPolicy: "fields"`, on by default), so the
 * plugin reads `{$wbEncrypted:1, envelope}` wrappers instead of token strings
 * (issues #39/#40). Everything needed to open them lives on the same machine:
 *
 * - the sealed payload (`{version:1, atRestSecretKey}`) comes from the
 *   WorkBuddy-modified Electron's private `workbuddyStorage` binding, reached
 *   by running *its own* binary once with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`;
 * - `protectorKey = sha256(atRestSecretKey, utf8)` opens the envelopes with
 *   AES-256-GCM; the AAD builder below is transcribed from the app's own
 *   `buildAuthenticatedContextAad` (verified live against 5.6.2, see
 *   `docs/r3-final.js` in the working copy — not committed).
 *
 * The plugin process itself can never call `_linkedBinding` (it runs in DSH's
 * Node, not the forked Electron), so the helper is spawned. The key is cached
 * in memory only, single-flight, and re-resolved when an envelope names a
 * different key id. Neither the payload, the key, nor any token is ever
 * logged; error messages carry sizes, ids, and exit codes only.
 *
