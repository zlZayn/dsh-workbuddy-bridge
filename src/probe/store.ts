 * What this stores is an *observation*, never a claim about the upstream: a
 * model's row is only consulted when the catalog carries no explicit
 * `supportedEfforts` set, and it always loses to a declared set. The plan this
 * implements (`docs/reasoning-effort-probe-plan.md` §5) requires that a result
 * is invalidated whenever the model's catalog row changes, so every record
 * carries a fingerprint of the fields the probe depended on.
 *
 * The file lives beside the plugin's own credential copy under `$DSH_HOME`,
 * never in the desktop app's files, and carries no token, prompt, or response
 * body — only model ids, effort spellings, and timestamps.
