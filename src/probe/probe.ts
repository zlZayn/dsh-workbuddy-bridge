/**
 * The reasoning-effort probe: decide whether a model's `reasoning_effort`
 * parameter is actually validated, and if so which canonical values it accepts.
 *
 * Implements `docs/reasoning-effort-probe-plan.md` §4. The order matters and is
 * not an optimization:
 *
 * 1. **Baseline** (no `reasoning_effort`) proves the model, credential, and
 *    request shape work at all, so a later rejection can be attributed.
 * 2. **Sentinel** (a fresh random, impossible-to-collide value) answers the one
 *    question a per-level sweep cannot: does the upstream validate the field?
 *    A model that accepts the sentinel answers 200 to *everything*, so its
 *    per-level results would be uniformly false positives.
 * 3. **Levels**, only after the sentinel was refused.
 *
 * The result is an observation, never a capability claim. Even a fully
 * successful sweep means "the upstream accepted these spellings", not "these
 * spellings change how the model thinks".
