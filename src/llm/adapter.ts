 *    the desktop app differs per model there. If the user authorized a probe
 *    and it established that the upstream *validates* the parameter, the
 *    verified spellings are offered.
 *
 * A `non-validating` observation deliberately yields no control: the upstream
 * accepts values that cannot exist (measured on `glm-5.2`), so every per-level
 * acceptance it produced would be a false positive.
 *
 * `off` is offered only when the upstream declares `canDisableThinking: true`.
 * It is never probed — disabling thinking is a separate capability, and the
 * per-model acceptance of `off` cannot be inferred from the row's shape.
 *
 * The offered set is described internally as "verified accepted", never as
 * "verified effective": acceptance proves the upstream did not reject the
 * spelling, not that it changes what the model does.
