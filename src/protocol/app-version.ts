/**
 * The international desktop app's version, used as the `/v3/config` UA.
 *
 * The App-shaped catalog is served only to a User-Agent carrying the product
 * name (see `docs/workbuddy-ai-international-research-2026-09-11.md` §2.7).
 * That document's conclusion recommended the space form `WorkBuddy AI/<v>`;
 * re-measured on 2026-09-11 the *space* form is rejected (HTTP 400, code
 * 12403) while the terse `WorkBuddyAI/<v>` form — with or without the space
 * removed — returns the 21-model App document. The UA is therefore built from
 * the form verified in code, not from the earlier prose.
 *
 * The version is only ever a UA component: a missing App, an unreadable
 * plist, or a bad cached value degrades to the last saved value and finally to
 * a compiled-in constant, and never blocks credential use or the provider.
 *
