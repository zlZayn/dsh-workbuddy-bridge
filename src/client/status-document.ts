/**
 * Whether a parsed status response really is a status document.
 *
 * A 200 is not a promise about the body: it may be empty, literal `null`, a
 * non-JSON page from a proxy, or an array. Both halves of the browser plugin
 * read the same route, so both must agree on what is valid — storing an
 * unreadable value puts something in state that the next render dereferences.
 *
 * The check is deliberately limited to the discriminator (plus `error`'s
 * `message`, which the error paragraph renders): validating optional fields
 * here would reject documents the host legitimately omits fields from.
 *
 * `reasonCode` is therefore *not* rejected here — a card renders `reason`
 * either way — but every reader must narrow it with
 * `isWorkBuddySignedOutReasonCode` before branching on it, since the wire
 * value is not guaranteed to be inside the enum.
