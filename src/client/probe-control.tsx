/**
 * Per-model reasoning-effort entry beside the Composer's model selector.
 *
 * It is **only an icon** — no inline text. The composer row is shared with the
 * host's own model picker, and a word here competes with the model name for the
 * same glance while adding nothing: the verified levels already appear in the
 * model dropdown (the adapter exposes them as selectable efforts). What the
 * control offers is an *action*, so it is drawn like the other icon-only
 * buttons in this chrome, and its meaning lives in the tooltip and the
 * accessible name.
 *
 * Styling follows `dsh-ds-balance`'s popover button, which copies the host's own
 * sidebar `.iconButton` (28px circle, `--dsw-alias-label-secondary` icon on a
 * transparent background, `--dsw-alias-interactive-bg-hover` on hover). The
 * artwork strokes `currentColor`, so light and dark themes are handled by the
 * token rather than by two sets of colours — no `[data-ds-dark-theme]` selector
 * and no hard-coded colour anywhere.
 *
 * - a **hover/focus tooltip** carries the state and the click's purpose, and is
 *   also the button's `aria-label`.
 * - the **confirmation** is a popover anchored to the control, not a
 *   `window.confirm`. Probing spends real credit, so a confirmation stays — but
 *   it belongs next to the thing it acts on.
 *
 * The popover surface follows `dsh-ds-balance`'s balance popover, which itself
 * copies the host's own stat dialog: a portal to `document.body`, positioned by
 * the host's `useAnchoredPosition`, dismissed by the host's
 * `useDismissOnOutsidePointer`, skinned with `--dsw-specific-menu` plus
 * `--dsw-menu-backdrop-filter` (the pair the host requires together — fill
 * alone is "translucent but not frosted").
 *
 * **The filter must not sit on the panel itself**: a non-`none`
 * `backdrop-filter` makes the element the containing block for its fixed
 * descendants, and this panel contains non-portal `Tooltip` bubbles. The fill
 * and the filter therefore live on an isolated `::before`, exactly as the host
 * does it.

/**
 * The control's icon: a light bulb, and the same bulb lit once a detection landed.
 *
 * Two states carry the whole story without a word:
 * - **bulb** — nothing verified yet; this is the model whose levels are still unknown.
 * - **bulb with the bolt** — a recorded result says which levels this model accepts.
 *
 * That is why the bolt is a second path rather than decoration: the trigger has to answer
 * "is this model checked?" at a glance, in 28px, next to the host's model picker — and the
 * panel that opens from it repeats the same glyph, so trigger, panel and result read as one
 * object. The artwork is the maintainer's bulb, redrawn on the host's 16-unit grid: ink spans
 * 2..14 vertically and 3.5..12.5 horizontally (the host's own icons keep a 6–9 inset), filled
 * with `currentColor` so both themes come from the button's colour alone — no literal colour,
 * no `[data-ds-dark-theme]` selector.
 *
 * The bolt appears only for a **successful** detection (`lit`), never while a run is in
 * flight and never for a failure: a spinner-shaped claim would be answered by the tooltip,
 * which already says exactly what happened.
