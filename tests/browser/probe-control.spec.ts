/**
 * The composer's reasoning-level bulb, in a real React tree.
 *
 * This control had **no render test at all** before this suite, which is how
 * both defects it now pins reached users:
 *
 * - the bulb's visibility was computed from "could this model be detected, or
 *   has it been", so it was absent on exactly the models whose thinking switch
 *   already worked — every declared model — and the user read that as broken;
 * - the `selection` guard tested `=== undefined` while the host's store
 *   initialises `current` to `null`, so the first frame dereferenced `null`,
 *   threw inside the host's slot boundary, and left the control gone for the
 *   life of the mount.
 *
 * The cases below therefore lead with **when the bulb exists** and **when it is
 * lit**, because those two answers are the whole contract: the bulb reports
 * "this model can switch thinking levels", not "someone ran a detection".
