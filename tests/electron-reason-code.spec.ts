 * Issue #48 §5.5: `reasonCode` must survive the host-side trip from the store
 * to the card.
 *
 * The card decides whether to offer the Agent assist block from this field
 * alone, so a code dropped here — or invented here — silently changes which
 * failures get a way out. These tests pin the pass-through and, just as
 * importantly, that nothing is inferred from the prose.
